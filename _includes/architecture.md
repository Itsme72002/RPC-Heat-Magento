Traditional web application models often have difficulties
translating to Cloud infrastructure. Larger failure domains, lack of expensive
shared storage, and generally less performant instances mean that some of
the assumptions we have grown into are no longer applicable in Cloud
environments.
 
Our Magento architecture is designed to provide a resilient platform
to host your ecommerce storefront in a Private Cloud. We have optimized
every component of the stack for Cloud Infrastructure. With a deployment
driven by the OpenStack Heat orchestration engine and Salt configuration
management, we are able to deliver Magento as a repeatable, scalable,
production-ready deployment.
